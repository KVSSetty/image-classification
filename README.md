# image-classification
Python programs for Image Classification using popular CNN architectures,such as **Lenet, Alexnet ,VGG nets, GooLenet , Inception nets and various configs of Resnets**.And mostly we will be using **Keras and Tensorflow** libraries as main tools.Some of the Datasets we will be using for trainging the nets are MNIST,CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100,ImageNet etc,.

Also we will be measuring the performance of each network using various performance measures such as **Accuracy, Precision, Recall,F1-Score and ROC-AUC score etc,.**
